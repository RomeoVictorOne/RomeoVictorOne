## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ryan Hensleyâ€”U.S. Navy veteran, civic wellness architect, and emerging AI systems builder operating as **RomeoVictorOne**.

For nearly 11 years, I served aboard destroyers as a Fire Controlman, leading human readiness initiatives where performance was non-negotiable. That experience shaped everything Iâ€™m building now.

Today, Iâ€™m learning to build with code and collaborate with AI. Iâ€™m new to GitHub, but not to systems-thinking, real-time operations, or human performance under pressure **holding the line when it matters most.**

  - **Romeo** â€“ my AI co-pilot for personal and civic optimization  
  - **The Human OS** â€“ a real-time system for wellness and alignment  
  - **Era Engineeringâ„¢** â€“ a framework to sync Consciousness, Environment, Energy, and Time
  - **Romeo Project (Beta)** â€“ Live prototype in Richmond, TX combining personal wellness data (bingingsober.com) with community signal tracking.
